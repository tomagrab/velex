### Setup Instructions

#### 1. Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md) (optional, but recommended for managing Node.js versions)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (>= 14.x) (do not install Node.js if you are using nvm; nvm will manage Node for you. Please read the nvm docs for more information.)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (>= 6.x) (no install required; npm comes with Node.js) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

#### 2. Cloning the Repository

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tomagrab/velex.git
    cd velex
```

#### 3. Installing Dependencies

Install the project dependencies using either npm or yarn.

- Using npm:

```bash
    npm install
```

- Using yarn:

```bash
    yarn install
```

#### 4. Environment Variables

**NOTE**: As of writing this, Velex does not use any environment variables. However, this will change in the future. Below are the general steps to set up environment variables for the project along with common variables for Auth0 and Clerk.

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory of the project. Add the following environment variables:

- Auth0

```bash
    NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_DOMAIN=your_auth0_domain
    NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=your_auth0_client_id
    NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback
    NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/
```

- Clerk

```bash
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_FRONTEND_API_KEY=your_clerk_frontend_api_key
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_OUT_REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:3000/
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

#### 5. Running the Development Server

Once your dependencies are installed, you can start the development server:

- Using npm:

```bash
    npm run dev
```

- Using yarn:

```bash
    yarn dev
```

Your Next.js app should now be running at http://localhost:3000

#### 6. Building for Production

To create an optimized production build, run:

- Using npm:

```bash
    npm run build
```

- Using yarn:

```bash
    yarn build
```

After building the project, you can start the production server:

- Using npm:

```bash
    npm run start
```

- Using yarn:

```bash
    yarn start
```

#### 8. Setting Up Authentication

Velex will use either Clerk or Auth0 for user authentication, however, as of writing this, one has not been chosen or implemented over the other. If you would like to implement your own solution before this repo officially makes a decision, follow the steps below to configure authentication:

#### Auth0 Setup:

1. Sign up for an Auth0 account at [Auth0](https://auth0.com/signup?place=header&type=button&text=sign%20up)
2. Create a new application in the [Auth0 dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/dashboard).
3. Add your Auth0 domain and client ID to your .env.local file.
4. Configure SSO with Microsoft accounts within your Auth0 settings.

**NOTE**: Steps 3 and 4 are general guidelines. Please refer to the official [Auth0 documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/nextjs/interactive) for detailed instructions.

#### Clerk Setup:

1. Sign up for a Clerk account at [Clerk](https://dashboard.clerk.com/sign-up?redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdashboard.clerk.com%2F).
2. Create a new application in the [Clerk dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/).
3. Add your Clerk frontend API key to the .env.local file.
4. Enable SSO with Microsoft accounts within Clerkâ€™s settings.

**NOTE**: Steps 3 and 4 are general guidelines. Please refer to the official [Clerk documentation](https://clerk.com/docs/quickstarts/nextjs) for detailed instructions.
